fakeweb (development)

* add support for Net::HTTP's undocumented full-URI request style (fixes
  URI::InvalidURIErrors that you might see in older libraries) [Chris Kampmeier]

* sort query params before storing internally, so that
  http://example.com/?a=1&b=2 and http://example.com/?b=2&a=1 are considered the
  same URL (although this is technically incorrect, it's much more
  convenient--most web apps work that way, and Net::HTTP's use of a hash to pass
  query params means that the order in which FakeWeb stores them can be
  unpredictable) [Chris Kampmeier]

* add support for ports in URLs, so that http://example.com/ and
  http://example.com:3000/ are not the same [Chris Kampmeier]

* fix for non-faked SSL requests failing with "Unable to create local socket"
  [Chris Kampmeier]

* update Rakefile to fix warning about deprecated code [Chris Kampmeier]
