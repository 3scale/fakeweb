FakeWeb - Helper for Faking Web Requests

= Synopsis

  :include:test/unit/test_examples.rb

= Description

FakeWeb is a helper for faking web requests. This makes testing easier,
because you can decouple your test environment from live services without
modifying code. It allows for a range of request behaviour, from simple
stubbing of HTTP responses to re-playing complete recorded responses.

In addition to the conceptual advantage of having idempotent request behaviour, 
FakeWeb makes tests run faster than if they were made to remote (or even local)
web servers. It also makes it possible to run tests without a network
connection or in situations where the server is behind a firewall or has
host based access controls.

FakeWeb is tested with
Net::HTTP[http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/net/http/rdoc/index.html] and
OpenURI[http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/open-uri/rdoc/]. It should work
with any web client library that uses Net::HTTP for its underlying requests
(e.g., Flickr.rb[http://redgreenblu.com/flickr/],
Ruby/Amazon[http://www.caliban.org/ruby/ruby-amazon.shtml],
soap4r[http://dev.ctor.org/soap4r/], etc.)

= Known Issues

* Request bodies are ignored, including GET, PUT, and POST parameters. If you
  need different responses for different request bodies, you need to request
  different URLs, and register different responses for each.
* Query-string parameter order is significant, so GET http://example.com/?a=1&b=1
  and GET http://example.com/?b=1&a=1 are considered different requests. This is
  technically correct, but it's often a nuisance in practice since 1) many servers
  return the same resource for any ordering of the key=value pairs, and
  2) Net::HTTP's use of a hash to specify query parameters means that the order
  is unpredictable.
